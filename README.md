## Getting Started

### 1. Create Your Account

## Important Notes

### File Search Capability
To utilize the attachments feature effectively, ensure that your OpenAI assistants have the "search in files" feature activated in their assistant settings.

### Message Retention
Messages stored in threads are subject to OpenAI API's default retention policy. For more information, please refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search)
