ðŸš€ Welcome to the Sherpa Coder extension for Visual Studio Code! âœ¨ This extension is designed to enhance your coding experience by integrating OpenAI assistants directly into your VS Code environment. ðŸ¤–

## Getting Started

### 1. Create Your Account
To begin using Sherpa Coder, you'll need to create an account. Simply provide an alias for your account name and enter your OpenAI API Key. All information is stored locally on your machine - there are no external servers involved, only direct communication with the OpenAI API. This will enable you to access all the powerful features of the extension.

### 10. Enhance with File Attachments
Take advantage of the powerful file attachment feature:
- Attach files directly from your workspace
- Generate and attach a markdown file containing your entire workspace's source code
- Provide context-rich information to the AI assistant

You can also attach the full source code of the current workspace. For this we will create a markdown file containing your source code. We will omit the files from gitignore and binary files that you might have in your workspace.

## Important Notes

### File Search Capability
To utilize the attachments feature effectively, ensure that your OpenAI assistants have the "search in files" feature activated in their assistant settings.

### Files Retention Policy
Files stored in threads are subject to OpenAI API's default retention policy. For more information, please refer to the [OpenAI documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/file-search)
